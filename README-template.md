# Lab Practicing Implementation with Frontend Mentor 3.2 
## Lab Overview
The purpose of this project is to demo the handoff process that occurs between designers and developers. These challenges, provided by Frontend Mentor, serve to allow me to:
-Recreate professional looking and accurate designs.
-Practice utilizing Figma files to style HTML code.
-Practice semantic HTML code.
-Create Responsive designs that adapt to the provided screen sizes.
------------------------------------------------
This is a solution to the [Blog preview card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blog-preview-card-ckPaj01IcS). Frontend Mentor challenges help me improve my coding skills by building realistic projects.

## My process
  I used the same workflow for creating both challenges, as they were very similar in concept.
  The main difference being *how* I recreated the look.
  The main steps: 
  1. Set up the basic HTML file with semantic elements.  
  2. Test in browser to ensure all parts are showing as expected.
  3. $ touch styles.css | Create a stylesheet. 
  4. Plan for & Start by setting up the base flex-box or grid structure.
    - The QR Code Card Challenge has a flex-box based layout.
    - The Blog Preview Challenge has a grid and flex-box based layout.
  5. Reference the Figma file continuously as I tweaked
    - Alignments & justifications.
    - Font size, weight, and color.
    - Element sizes to better match Figma file's dimentions.
    - Spacing, padding, margins, and borders.
    - CSS function effects (specifically for the blog preview)
    - CSS :hover and :focus states (specifically for the blog preview)
  6. Once a design is finished, I added a media query for the smaller mobile screen size.

  Additionally for the Blog Preview Challenge, I added a tab index of 0. This is so that the the card will react
  when tabbed to as well.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Figma is actually *extremely* helpful to me when developing the CSS document. 
I was able to easily go check the properties of each element to get **actual** pixel perfect accuracy.
I believe I will use it for more designs in the future. Especially more complicated ones. 

<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>


### Useful resources

- [MDN drop-shadow()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter-function/drop-shadow) - This helped me for creating the drop shadow in the blog preview challenge. It was so much easier than my method of using a div. I plan to use it again!
- [CSS Tricks- CSS Grid Layout Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid) - This article is great for refreshing on grid. I sometimes overcomplicate the process as I'm sitll mastering it. This was shared to me and my cohort by **Tishana Trainor** and it will continue to be something I reference.
